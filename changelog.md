### Added

## [1.1.6] - 2020-09-20

### Fixed

- Adds the `com.apple.WebKit.custom-pasteboard-data` pasteboard type to the filter list, to fix an issue with copying and pasting styled text to and from Atlassian's [Confluence](https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html). Thanks to Harry Strand for the bug report!

### Changed

- Update xcodeproj format to "Xcode 12.0-compatible"
- Extract `pasteboardTypeFIlterList` into a variable within `PasteboardMonitor`, and make `plaintextifiedCopy` into a method with the filtered types as an argument
	- This is to make unit testing and future debugging easier

### Added

- Added some tests for the new `plaintextifiedCopy` method

## [1.1.5] - 2020-09-15

### Fixed

- Adds the `com.apple.webarchive` pasteboard type to the filter list, to fix an issue specifically with copying styled text from a web page, and pasting into a Gmail compose field. Thanks to Christopher Stout for the bug report!

### Changed

- Changed build numbering scheme to comply with App Store requirements.

## [1.1.4] - 2020-09-12

### Added

- Adds `.html` to the pasteboard types to filter.
- Adds a test for the `.html` filter.

### Changed

- Links on web page now point to the App Store version.

## [1.1.3] - 2020-09-10

### Fixed

- Fixes a crash that would happen if you enabled, disabled, then re-enabled filtering again.
	- This was caused by trying to re-enable a cancelled GCD timer. The fix was to "suspend" the timer rather than cancel it.

### Added

- Adds a unit test target and some unit tests to verify the pasteboard filtering functionality

## [1.1.2] - 2020-09-08

### Fixed

- Fixes a regression where the pasteboard would sometimes get incorrectly overwritten to empty

### Changed

- Improved console debugging of `NSPasteboardItem` objects
- Changed changelog layout slightly to highlight fixes before changes

## [1.1.1] - 2020-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in handling named URLs on the pasteboard by adding a few more types to the type filtered list:
- `public.url-name`
- `CorePasteboardFlavorType 0x75726C6E`
- `WebURLsWithTitlesPboardType`
- Dynamic pasteboard types, which are any type beginning with `dyn.` - I learned of these via [this blog post](https://camdez.com/blog/2010/07/21/nspasteboard-and-dynamic-utis/) by [@camdez](https://github.com/camdez)

### Changed

- Extracted pasteboard filtering to its own method as an extension on `NSPasteboardItem`

## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that would cause images on the pasteboard to be removed ([reported](https://github.com/hisaac/PlainPasta/issues/3) by [@foigus](https://github.com/foigus). Thanks!)

### Changed

- Move to using GCD instead of `Timer` for repeat polling of the pasteboard. This provides a small increase in performance.
- Update entitlements file to allow for automatic creation of App ID in App Store Connect
- Remove "Check for Updatesâ€¦" menu item, as this will now be done through the App Store
- Enable App Sandboxing for Mac App Store
- Enable hardened runtime
